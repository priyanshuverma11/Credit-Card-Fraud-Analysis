#Introduction

In today’s world, we are on the express train to a cashless society. It’s expected that in future years there will be a steady growth of non-cash transactions.

Now, while this might be exciting, but on the flip-side fraudulent transactions are on the rise as well. Even with EMV smart chips being implemented, we still have a very high amount of money lost from credit card fraud.

What can we do to reduce the risk? While there are a lot of methods to limit the loss and prevent fraud, and we’ll walk you through our process and show you our findings. To solve this problem, we’re creating a “Credit Card Fraud Analysis Model using Machine Learning”. The datasets we’ll be using will be gathered from a kaggle dataset which contains 285,000 rows of data and 31 columns.
